# Guide
 _network_training.ipynb_ - network training code (from https://github.com/ansuini/IntrinsicDimDeep)
 
  _computation_time.ipynb_ - the code how we calculated the computation time of the persistent homology of random arrays
 
 _graphics.ipynb_ - diffusionmap calculation and graphs
 
 In folder _diffusionmap_graphs_ are the diffusion maps that we calculated with VGG16 network checkpoints using three different ImageNet classes: mix, n01882714  (koalas) and n02086240 (Shih Tzu). 
 
 In folder _pics_  you can view all the pictures we have made (including the ones we didn't add to our blogpost).
