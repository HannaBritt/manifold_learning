Make folder INSIDE the IntrinsicDimDeep (https://github.com/ansuini/IntrinsicDimDeep).

# Progress
3.05 - reproduced figure 2.A
6.05 - meeting to discuss next steps.

# Need to do
- Reproduce the result with different intrinsic dimensionality algorithm (https://github.com/dgranata/Intrinsic-Dimension)
- Characterise the topology (persistent homology) and a bit of the geometry (diffusion maps) of the manifold.
